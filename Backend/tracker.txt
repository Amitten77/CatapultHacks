# tracker logic

if food has been added:
    if food not in database: 
        new item
    else:
        old_food = food item database entry
        if old_food.status = "REMOVED" and curr_time - old_food.time_removed < 2 hours:
            food has been added back in
            old_food.status = "IN FRIDGE
        else:
            new item
if food has been removed:
    food.status = "REMOVED"
    food.time_removed = curr_time

Note: 
    for each new item:
        find expiration date
        add entry to database (item name, expiration data, "IN FRIDGE", curr_time)

Note:
    to keep the database small, if a food has been removed, and it's been over 2 hours (food has been consumed),
    we could delete the entry from the database


# food status logic

take 2 images in quick succession
run first image through gpt
    if there's nothing in the frame, don't use the second image
    else:
        run the second image through gpt and ask it for whether the images are moving closer or further away
        if image is moving closer -> item is being added
        else item is being removed
